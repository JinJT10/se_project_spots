**Intro**
  
This project was developed for users to customize their page from their name, a small description of themselves, and posting images. The profile page was also adapts to different screen resolutions for the majority of mobile users. Following the design given from the Figma, I utilized media queries, grid, and flexbox; I was able to style the page that is suitable for most screen sizes and accessible. 

A neat and presentable fashion that drives the point across and similar to well known social media pages; being easy on the eyes and is as responsible as possible to users.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Improvements**

At this current stage of when this page was developed, I would like to
add the functionality to post images w/ captions, view enlarged modals of each post (perhaps w/ a comment section for other users), and clean up the code as I become experienced with HTML and CSS.
