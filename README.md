**Intro**
  
This project is a profile page that is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on mobile devices. Following the design given from the Figma, I utilized media queries, grid, and flexbox; I was able to style the page that is suitable for most screen sizes and accessible. 

A neat and presentable fashion that drives the point across and similar to well known social media pages; being easy on the eyes.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
